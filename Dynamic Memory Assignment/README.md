INSTRUCTIONS

This program is meant to display the ability to dynamically create and destroy an array of "book" objects. 
These objects store a title, genre, and reading score (which is randomly generated using srand()).
When all of the books are entered in using the console, the program proceeds to display all of the information
for each book object. After this, the books are freed from memory and the program terminates.
